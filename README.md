# k8c-certs-manager
This Custom Kubernetes Controller enable developers on any Kubernetes clusters to request TLS certificates 
that they can incorporate into their application deployments.

## Description
We have a Kubernetes cluster on which we can run applications. These applications will often expose HTTP 
endpoints through which other applications and end users can access them. To make sure that a secure connection 
to those endpoints is possible, we want to provide an automated and self-service way of requesting TLS 
certificates to secure incoming traffic.Developers deploying their applications can include a custom ‚ÄúCertificate‚Äù 
resource with their application manifest so that they don‚Äôt need to interact with an external system to request certificates.
This Custom Controller watches a custom resource ‚ÄúCertificate‚Äù, processes it and creates matching TLS certificate 
secrets. Certificates issued by this controller do not need to be signed by a CA (they should be self-signed). This 
also automatically renew a Certificate when it expires.
Minimum CRD this resource required is:
```yaml
apiVersion: certs.k8c.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: k8c-certs-manager
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
  name: certificate-sample
spec:
  dnsName: example.k8c.io
  validity: 360d
  secretRef:
    name: my-certificate-secret
```

The Event flow for the Controller is described in the diagram:

![workflow.png](workflow.png)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.21.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

## Deployment Workflow

![deployment.png](deployment.png)

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/k8s-cert-manager:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands don‚Äôt work.

### To Install
**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/k8s-cert-manager:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/certs_v1_certificate.yaml
```
This will create a Certificate resource in your Kubernetes Cluster and Create a Certificate Store at SecretRef provide as part of Resource Definition

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/certs_v1_certificate.yaml
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/k8c-certs-manager:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/k8c-certs-manager/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

## Controller Demo

To perform the Demo make sure you have:
1. Install and Create a local kubernetes cluster using kind [steps](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/). Also apply the `ingress-config` as follow:
```sh
pprtik@Pratiks-MBP k8c-certs-manager % kind create cluster --image=kindest/node:v1.23.6@sha256:1af0f1bee4c3c0fe9b07de5e5d3fafeb2eec7b4e1b268ae89fcab96ec67e8355 --config=config/samples/ingress-config.yaml --name kubermatics-demo
Creating cluster "kubermatics-demo" ...
 ‚úì Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.23.6) üñº
 ‚úì Preparing nodes üì¶
 ‚úì Writing configuration üìú
 ‚úì Starting control-plane üïπÔ∏è
 ‚úì Installing CNI üîå
 ‚úì Installing StorageClass üíæ
Set kubectl context to "kind-kubermatics-demo"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kubermatics-demo

Not sure what to do next? üòÖ  Check out https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/
```
*Note: Enable ingress controller on your cluster*
`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/kind/deploy.yaml`
2. Build and Push your DockerImage to public repository as follow:
```sh
prtik@Pratiks-MBP k8c-certs-manager % make docker-build docker-push IMG=pnarodemacrometa/k8c-certs-manager:latest
docker build -t pnarodemacrometa/k8c-certs-manager:latest .

```
3. Using the docker image generate the distribution script which will install all the required CRD, Configurations and Start Manager in your cluster.
```sh
prtik@Pratiks-MBP k8c-certs-manager % make build-installer IMG=pnarodemacrometa/k8c-certs-manager:latest
/Users/prtik/playground/kubernetes/k8c-certs-manager/bin/controller-gen rbac:roleName=manager-role crd webhook paths="./..." output:crd:artifacts:config=config/crd/bases
/Users/prtik/playground/kubernetes/k8c-certs-manager/bin/controller-gen object:headerFile="hack/boilerplate.go.txt" paths="./..."
mkdir -p dist
cd config/manager && /Users/prtik/playground/kubernetes/k8c-certs-manager/bin/kustomize edit set image controller=pnarodemacrometa/k8c-certs-manager:latest
/Users/prtik/playground/kubernetes/k8c-certs-manager/bin/kustomize build config/default > dist/install.yaml
```
*Note: This generates the install script in dist/install.yaml. Also in the install.yaml script substitute the caBundle for webhooks client configuration generated using $ cat webhook-certs | base64*
4. Install and Deploy the controller in your cluster:
```sh
prtik@Pratiks-MBP k8c-certs-manager % kubectl apply -f dist/install.yaml
namespace/k8c-certs-manager-system created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/certificates.certs.k8c.io created
serviceaccount/k8c-certs-manager-controller-manager created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/k8c-certs-manager-leader-election-role created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/k8c-certs-manager-certificate-editor-role created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/k8c-certs-manager-certificate-viewer-role created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/k8c-certs-manager-manager-role created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/k8c-certs-manager-metrics-auth-role created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/k8c-certs-manager-metrics-reader created

clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/k8c-certs-manager-manager-rolebinding created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/k8c-certs-manager-metrics-auth-rolebinding created
secret/k8c-certs-manager-webhook-server-cert created
service/k8c-certs-manager-controller-manager-metrics-service created
service/k8c-certs-manager-webhook-service created
deployment.apps/k8c-certs-manager-controller-manager created
mutatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io/k8c-certs-manager-mutating-webhook-configuration created
validatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io/k8c-certs-manager-validating-webhook-configuration created
```
*Note: This deploys all the required configuration to your cluster*
5. Now deploy the  Sample Application Instance to create an Application, Add Certificate and Create Ingress Controller with TLS Secrets created using your
   Controller:
```sh
prtik@Pratiks-MBP k8c-certs-manager % kubectl apply -f config/samples/hello_app.yaml
deployment.apps/hello created
service/hello-service created
certificate.certs.k8c.io/certificate-sample created
ingress.networking.k8s.io/tls-ingress created
```
*Example Configuration*

                      port:
                         number: 8081

```
6. Once this is applied successfully add etc/hosts entry for the dns you specified pointing to `127.0.0.1`
```sh
prtik@Pratiks-MBP k8c-certs-manager % cat /etc/hosts
## etc host entries

127.0.0.1   example.k8c.io

```
7. Point your browser to the dnsName and you would see your application being served behind a Self Signed Certificate
